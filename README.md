# IMACCU

Image Measurement And Camera Calibration Utility

## What is IMACCU?

IMACCU is a simple GUI tool that provides You a quick interface for:
- measuring points in the images
- calculating the camera calibration based on the measurements

IMACCU provides the simple interface for the automatic measrurement of the most poplular calibration pattern which is a chessboard.What is very usefull IMACCU allows You to manually delete particular measurements (like outliers or gross errors) or edit them. The above would be quite a cumbersome issue without having a GUI! The detailed calibration report contains outliers of each measurement as well as standard deviations of each calibration parameter.
